# Ignis

A modern, high performance interaction engine.

I switched over to Cog because I realized that I had never actually written a large scale project before, 
and I decided to do it from scratch for Ignis. Yeah, wasn't a great idea. So I decided to write a nice game engine in Rust, 
with all the lovely memory safety and easy dependency management (yay Cargo!), before continuing with Ignis.
